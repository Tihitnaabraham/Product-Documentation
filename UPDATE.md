# RenewIt Product Updates & Versions

This document tracks the development progress, updates, and version history of the RenewIt platform.

## About RenewIt and Its Development Journey

RenewIt began as a research-driven initiative focused on addressing challenges in the second-hand clothes ecosystem, specifically around the Dandora dump site in Nairobi. Our aim was to create a sustainable platform that connects traders selling reclaimed materials with upcyclers looking to creatively repurpose those materials.

The development life cycle included:

- Conducting thorough research on second-hand clothes and the environmental and social issues related to waste at the Dandora dump.
- Applying product management principles to define scope, target users, and workflows.
- Designing intuitive user experiences and interfaces with detailed UX/UI mockups.
- Architecting the system with database design including Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) and integrating AI agents for automatic material matching.
- Developing the backend with APIs that power the core functionality of matching, payments, and notifications.
- Building the frontend using Jetpack Compose for Android and React for Dashboards.
- Testing, refining, and finalizing the product for public launch.
