## 1. How do payments work on RenewIt?

Payments on RenewIt are handled through M-Pesa using the **prompt-to-pay (STK Push)** method.  
After upcyclers accept matched offers from traders:  
- They receive a payment prompt on their mobile phone.  
- The upcycler authorizes payment by entering their M-Pesa PIN.  
- Both the upcycler and trader receive real-time payment confirmation.  
Once payment succeeds, the transaction status updates within RenewIt.

## 2. How does the matching system operate?

RenewIt features an automated matching engine that:  
- Scans upcycler material requests when submitted.  
- Compares request details (type, quantity, condition) against trader listings.  
- If a match is found, the system sends a notification to the upcycler with details of the matched trader’s offer.  
- The upcycler can then review and choose to proceed or decline the match.  
This improves efficiency by proactively showing relevant offers and reducing manual search efforts.

## 3. How is the total price calculated?

The total price is dynamically calculated by RenewIt based on:  
- The upcycler’s required quantity per kilogram.  
- The quantity specified by the upcycler in their material request (e.g., 50 kg).  
The system multiplies the unit price by the requested quantity to give an accurate total cost before the upcycler accepts the offer.

## 4. How do I pay using M-Pesa on RenewIt?

After you accept a trader’s matched offer for your material request, RenewIt sends you an **M-Pesa prompt-to-pay notification** directly to your mobile phone. This notification asks you to authorize the payment by entering your M-Pesa PIN. You do **not** need to manually enter payment details like Till or Paybill numbers — RenewIt automatically populates the request for a seamless payment experience.

## 5. What is the M-Pesa prompt-to-pay process?

RenewIt initiates the M-Pesa payment request (called **STK Push**), which sends a payment prompt straight to your phone. The prompt asks for payment confirmation:  
- You authenticate the payment by entering your M-Pesa PIN.  
- Once authorized, the payment is processed immediately.  
- Both you and the trader receive real-time SMS and in-app payment confirmation.  
This process reduces errors and speeds up payment by eliminating the manual entry of merchant details.

## 6. Is my payment secure?

Yes. M-Pesa payments are highly secure because:  
- Every transaction requires you to enter your private M-Pesa PIN to authorize payment.  
- Both payer and payee receive transaction confirmation SMS messages for transparency.  
- The prompt-to-pay system eliminates manual input of merchant numbers, reducing fraudulent or mistaken payments.  
- RenewIt initially operates payment flows in the M-Pesa sandbox (testing) environment, ensuring reliability before moving to production with full security.

## 7. What happens if the payment fails?

If the payment fails due to network issues, insufficient funds, incorrect PIN, or other reasons:  
- RenewIt notifies you immediately that payment was unsuccessful.  
- You can retry the payment following the same prompt-to-pay process.  
Prompt and clear communication ensures swift resolution of payment problems.

## 8. Can I cancel my request or listing?

- **Upcyclers:** You can cancel material requests that have not yet been matched or accepted by traders via the dashboard.  
- **Traders:** You may remove or deactivate material listings at any time before a request is accepted.
